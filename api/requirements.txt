# Python dependencies for Vercel serverless functions
# Note: RDKit is large and may cause cold start issues
# Consider using external API for production or optimize with custom build

# For molecule validation and chemistry operations
# rdkit==2023.9.4  # Commented out - too large for Vercel serverless
# Alternative: Use lightweight chemistry library or external API

# Lightweight alternatives
pydantic==2.5.3
fastapi==0.109.0  # For request/response models only
