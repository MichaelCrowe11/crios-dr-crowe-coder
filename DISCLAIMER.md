## Safety Warnings

### üõ°Ô∏è Computational Predictions Are Not Guarantees

- **No Safety Assurance**: Computational predictions do not guarantee the safety, efficacy, or legal status of any compound
- **Experimental Validation Required**: All computational results require extensive experimental validation
- **False Predictions Possible**: Models may produce false positives and false negatives
- **Limited Training Data**: Predictions are only as good as the underlying training data

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Regulatory Compliance

- **Know Your Jurisdiction**: Users are solely responsible for compliance with local, national, and international laws
- **Controlled Substances**: The software includes NO lists of controlled substances - users must implement their own legal safeguards
- **Export Controls**: Users must comply with applicable export control regulations
- **Professional Oversight**: Chemical synthesis and drug development require appropriate professional supervision

### üß™ Chemical Safety

- **Laboratory Safety**: Any chemical synthesis based on computational predictions requires proper safety protocols
- **Toxicity Assessment**: Computational toxicity predictions are preliminary and require experimental validation
- **Environmental Impact**: Consider environmental and ecological impacts of any synthesized compounds
- **Waste Disposal**: Follow appropriate procedures for chemical waste disposal
