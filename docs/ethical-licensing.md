# Ethical Licensing: Mission-Locked IP Structure

## Philosophy

All discoveries flowing from the **Crowe Discovery Framework** are protected by a mission-locked IP structure controlled by **Crowe BioSystems**. This ensures that science is not siloed, stolen, or scaled without soul.

> *"We are not building a lab. We are seeding a forest of discovery."*

## Core Principles

### 1. Science Before Status
- Merit over credentials in all collaboration decisions
- Open publication of negative results and failure patterns
- Recognition of lived experience as valid scientific input

### 2. Discovery Before Profit  
- Impact metrics prioritized over revenue maximization
- Affordable access provisions for breakthrough therapeutics
- Reinvestment of profits into regenerative discovery research

### 3. Earth and People Above Extraction
- Environmental impact assessment for all discoveries
- Community benefit requirements for local applications
- Regenerative impact: discoveries must give back more than they take

## IP Protection Strategy

### Patents Filed
1. **Method Patent**: CriOS Nova discovery methodology and algorithms
2. **Composition Patents**: Novel compounds across neurotherapeutics, environmental health, sustainable materials
3. **Analog Patents**: AI-generated molecular variations with predicted activity
4. **Polymer Patents**: Biodegradable materials with specified degradation profiles

### Trade Secrets
- **CriOS Nova algorithms**: Core AI models and training methodologies

- **Regenerative Obligations**: Environmental and social benefit reporting

### 2. Accessibility Protections  
- **Price Controls**: Maximum pricing formulas for essential medicines
- **Geographic Accessibility**: Preferential licensing for underserved regions
- **Open Source Pathways**: Automatic open-sourcing after ethical impact thresholds

### 3. Knowledge Sharing Mandates
- **Negative Results Publication**: Failures must be shared with research community
- **Safety Data Transparency**: All toxicity and side effect data publicly available
- **Methodology Openness**: Core discovery methods published after commercialization
