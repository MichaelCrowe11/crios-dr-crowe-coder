## Slide 1: Title
# **CriOS Discovery Engine**
## Accelerating Discovery, Protecting Tomorrow™

**AI-Powered Drug Discovery Platform**
*Reducing Time, Cost, and Risk in Pharmaceutical Development*

## Slide 2: The $2.6 Billion Problem

### **Current Drug Development Crisis**

- **$2.6B** average cost per approved drug
- **90%** of drugs fail in clinical trials  
- **10-15 years** from discovery to market
- **43%** fail due to safety issues discovered late

### **The Hidden Cost**
**Every day of delay = $1M in lost revenue**

## Slide 3: Why Failures Happen

### **Root Causes of Late-Stage Failures**

```
Discovery → Preclinical → Phase I → Phase II → Phase III → Market
   ↓           ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓
  20%         30%         40%       60%        90% cumulative failure
```

**Key Issues**:
- ❌ Toxicity not predicted early
- ❌ Poor ADMET properties
- ❌ Efficacy overestimated
- ❌ Safety signals missed

**Result**: $200M+ wasted per late-stage failure

---

## Slide 4: The CriOS Solution

### **AI-Powered Discovery with Built-In Safety**

**Traditional Approach**:
```
Discover → Synthesize → Test → Fail (90%)
(Months)    (Weeks)    (Months) (Years)
```

**CriOS Approach**:
```
Discover + Validate + Ethics Check → Synthesize → Test → Succeed (40%)
        (Milliseconds)                (Weeks)    (Months)
```

### **10x Faster • 5x Higher Success Rate • 100% Ethical**

- Success rate: 3%
- Late failures: 2/year @ $200M = $400M
- **Total cost**: $600M/year

**With CriOS**:
- Discovery: 1.5 years @ $51M/year = $76.5M
- Success rate: 8% (+167%)
- Late failures: 0.5/year @ $200M = $100M
- **Total cost**: $176.5M/year

### **Net Savings: $423.5M/year**
### **Plus: 2.5 years faster to market = $2.5B NPV**
