# CriOS Nova: Self-Refining AI Agent Architecture

## Overview

**CriOS Nova** is the AI heart of the Crowe Discovery Framework - a self-refining, human-in-the-loop agent that evolves with every experimental loop, uniting data, domain expertise, and lived experience into an autonomous partner for molecular discovery.

## Core Philosophy: Mycelial Intelligence

CriOS Nova is built on **mycelial thinking** - drawing inspiration from fungal networks that are:

- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Persistent**: Survives and adapts through disruption  
- **Regenerative**: Grows stronger through each iteration
- **Interconnected**: Shares knowledge across the entire network

## Architecture Components

### 1. The Discovery Loop

```
Hypothesis → Generation → Validation → Integration → Evolution
     ↑                                                   ↓
     └─────────────── Feedback Loop ────────────────────┘
```

#### Input Phase
- **Human hypothesis**: Disease target, environmental challenge, material need
- **Domain expertise**: Literature, patents, experimental data
- **Lived experience**: Researcher intuition, failure patterns, edge cases

#### Processing Phase
- **Structural similarity mapping**: Tanimoto, ECFP, pharmacophore analysis
- **Novel analog generation**: AI-guided molecular design with ethical constraints
- **Multi-property prediction**: ADMET, binding affinity, selectivity modeling
- **Patent landscape analysis**: Freedom-to-operate assessment

#### Output Phase  
- **Ranked candidates**: Prioritized by impact, feasibility, novelty
- **Synthesis protocols**: Practical routes with resource optimization
- **Validation experiments**: Assays prioritized by information gain

#### Evolution Phase
- **Experimental feedback integration**: Success/failure patterns
- **Model refinement**: Bayesian updates to prediction algorithms
- **Ethical alignment checking**: Ensures discoveries serve healing

### 2. Agent Specializations

Unlike traditional single-model AI, CriOS Nova consists of specialized sub-agents:

#### **Dr. Crowe Coder** - Lead Integration Agent
- **Role**: Orchestrates discovery workflows, biological pattern recognition
- **Specialization**: Mycelial algorithms, adaptive systems, ethical constraints
- **Intelligence**: Claude Sonnet 4 with biological computing enhancements

#### **Neurotherapeutic Agent**
- **Role**: CNS drug discovery, blood-brain barrier optimization
- **Database**: Alzheimer's/Parkinson's literature, clinical trial data
- **Validation**: *In vitro* neuronal assays, transgenic model predictions

#### **Environmental Health Agent**
- **Role**: Microplastic sequestration, detoxification compounds
- **Database**: Toxicology data, environmental exposure studies
- **Validation**: Binding affinity to plastic polymers, biocompatibility

#### **Materials Science Agent**
- **Role**: Biodegradable polymers, sustainable chemistry
- **Database**: Green chemistry literature, biodegradation studies
- **Validation**: Degradation kinetics, mechanical properties

### 3. Ethical Intelligence Layer

Every CriOS Nova decision passes through an **Ethical Intelligence Filter**:

#### Core Principles
- **Science before status**: Merit over credentials
- **Discovery before profit**: Impact over revenue
- **Earth and people above extraction**: Sustainability over exploitation

#### Implementation
- **Impact scoring**: Environmental and health benefit weighting
- **Accessibility checks**: Ensure discoveries reach those who need them
- **Regenerative validation**: Does this compound/material give back more than it takes?

### Learning Mechanisms

#### 1. **Active Learning**
- Identifies experiments with highest information gain
- Balances exploration (novel chemical space) with exploitation (optimization)
- Prioritizes experiments that resolve model uncertainty

#### 2. **Transfer Learning**
- Knowledge from neurotherapeutics informs environmental health
- Cross-domain pattern recognition (molecular motifs, toxicity patterns)
- Accelerates discovery in new domains

#### 3. **Meta-Learning**
- Learns how to learn from experimental feedback
- Adapts learning rate based on domain and researcher
- Develops intuition for when to trust vs. question predictions
